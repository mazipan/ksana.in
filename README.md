```sql
create table urls (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  real_url text check (char_length(real_url) > 1),
  slug text check (char_length(slug) > 1),
  hit integer default 0,
  is_dynamic boolean default false,
  inserted_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);
```

Add triggers for _"updated_at"_ field, copy this code on the same SQL editor

-- this trigger will set the "updated_at" column to the current timestamp for every update

## Additional settings for Authentication

- To support Google Login, in Authentication setting page, set the `Google Client ID` and `Google Secret`
- Increase JWT expiry time to `604800` for longer session. It's on on Authentication setting menu

## Register you own Splitbee

Ksana.in using Splitbee for Analytic, if you plan to deploy it by yourself, you might need to register your own Splitbee account.

## Can I deploy to my own domain?

The code is open for learning purpose.
But in case you didn't like the default domain (`ksana.in`), feel free to deploy to your own domain.
Since Ksana.in is using a free plan from Supabase, it have many limitation in term of size.
If you plan to use it in the bigger frequency, I suggest to deploy it with your own Supabase plan.
