## Installation

Copy file `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and change value with your own supabase url and anonymous key.
You can get it after register and create your own project on Supabase.io.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## Create table `urls` on Supabase

Go to the SQL tab and execute this query on the editor.

```sql
create table urls (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  real_url text check (char_length(real_url) > 1),
  slug text check (char_length(slug) > 1),
  hit integer default 0,
  inserted_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);
```

Click **RUN** to execute the query

Add triggers for "updated_at" field, copy this code on the same SQL editor

```sql
create extension if not exists moddatetime schema extensions;

-- this trigger will set the "updated_at" column to the current timestamp for every update
create trigger handle_updated_at before update on urls 
  for each row execute procedure moddatetime (updated_at);
```

Click **RUN** to execute the query

## Additional settings for Authentication

- on Authentication setting, change `Site URL` to `/callback`. e.g: `https://ksana.in/callback`, for development just set it to `http://localhost:3000/callback`
- To support Google Login, in Authentication setting page, set the `Google Client ID` and `Google Secret`

## Add environment variables on Vercel

You can found all required environment variables on `.env.local.example`

## Register you own Splitbee

Ksana.in using Splitbee for Analytic, if you plan to deploy it by yourself, you might need to register your own Splitbee account.

## Can I deploy to my own domain?

The code is open for learning purpose.
But in case you didn't like the default domain (`ksana.in`), feel free to deploy to your own domain.
Since Ksana.in is using a free plan from Supabase, it have many limitation in term of size.
If you plan to use it in the bigger frequency, I suggest to deploy it with your own Supabase plan.
